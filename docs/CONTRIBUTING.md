# Contribution Guide

Welcome to the contribution guide for the R-Type project! We're excited that you want to contribute to our project. Your contributions are essential to enhance and evolve R-Type. Before you begin, please follow these steps to ensure that your contribution is smooth and effective.

## Basic Rules

### Branches

- `master`: The main branch, always stable.
- `develop`: Development branch where features are merged before reaching `master`.
- Create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix.

### Commits

- Write clear and concise commit messages.
- Use our commit convention:
  - `[TYPE] brief commit description` where `[TYPE]` is:
    - `[ADD]` for a new feature
    - `[FIX]` for bug resolution
    - `[DEL]` for feature deletion
    - `[MDFY]` for feature modification
- Add comments as needed, especially for complex parts of the code.
