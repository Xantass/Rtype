A local version can be compiled after cloning the repository or downloading the latest source code from the [release section of the Github repository](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2026/B-FUN-500-PAR-5-1-glados-theo.fouque/releases) and executing the following commands at the root of the repository :
```
make
```

### Client

## Documentation
### In-code documentation
Our in-code documentation can is written directly in our sources files and can be clearly formated with Doxygen by executing this command at the root of the repository once cloned :
```
make doc
# doxygen is required
```
A webpage should automatically open with the generated documentation.
### Other documentations
All other documentations (including RFC protocol between client and server) can be found in [the Wiki section of the Github repository](https://github.com/EpitechPromo2026/B-CPP-500-PAR-5-2-rtype-jules.gresset/wiki).
